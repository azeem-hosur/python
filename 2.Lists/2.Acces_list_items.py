# Access Items
# List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number

print(my_list[1])

# Negative Indexing
# Negative indexing means start from the end

# -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.
print(my_list[-1])

# Range of Indexes
# You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.

# When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[3:6])

# Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).

# Remember that the first item has index 0.

# By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item
print(thislist[:4])

# By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list
print(thislist[2:])

# Range of Negative Indexes
# Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list
print(thislist[-4:-1])

# Check if Item Exists
# To determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword
